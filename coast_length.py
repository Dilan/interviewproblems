# You will be given a map of Soteholm as an NÃ—M grid.

#         N
#  ~   ~  ~   ~
#  ~   __ __  ~
#  ~  |__|__| ~    M
#  ~  |__| ~  __
#  ~   ~   ~ |__|
#  ~   ~  ~   ~

# Each square in the grid has a side length of 1 km and is either water or land.
# Your goal is to compute the total length of sea coast of all islands.
# Sea coast is all borders between land and sea, and sea is any water connected
# to an edge of the map only through water.

# Two squares are connected if they share an edge. You may assume that the map is
# surrounded by sea. Lakes and islands in lakes are not contributing to the sea coast.
