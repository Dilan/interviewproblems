/*
 Suppose we could access yesterday's stock prices as an array, where:

 The indices are the time in minutes past trade opening time, which was 9:30am local time.
 The values are the price in dollars of Apple stock at that time.
 So if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, stockPricesYesterday[60] = 500.

 Write an efficient function that takes stockPricesYesterday and returns the best profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock yesterday.

 For example:
 int[] stockPricesYesterday = new int[]{10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9};
 getMaxProfit(stockPricesYesterday);
 // returns 6 (buying for $5 and selling for $11)

 No "shorting"â€”you must buy before you sell. You may not buy and sell in the same time step (at least 1 minute must pass).
